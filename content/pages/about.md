**Isak Kvam is a Minnesota-based writer who specializes in making environmental policy, climate technology, and ecology accessible to both technical and general audiences.** His work helps readers navigate complex topics like climate change, sustainable land use, and outdoor recreation.

With a background in ecology, writing, and policy, Isak writes short- and long-form explainers on environmental issues. His non-fiction work often explores how environmental and climate policy affects communities, how the clean energy transition is being implemented, and reflections on public lands and outdoor recreation.

Isak grew up on the prairies of Minnesota. Over the years, he's guided canoe trips on the Minnesota River, studies climate changes impact on plant communities at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, and studied geology in the Apennine Mountains of Italy. He wrote an environmental column for his hometown newspaper, served as a writer and communication strategist for a Midwestern non-profit, then became a full-time freelance outdoor writer. He is currently a writer at the Minnesota decarbonization non-profit Fresh Energy.

In addition to writing, Isak has also worked as an entrepreneur. He co-founded Seek More Wilderness, an outdoor apparel store that donated 50% of profits to protecting public lands. He also co-founded ModernKind, a sustainable waterless haircare company providing high-quality goods without plastic waste or harsh chemicals.

Isak enjoys long road trips across the U.S. with his wife in their self-converted van, balancing creative projects with birding, downhill skiing, and exploring new public lands.
