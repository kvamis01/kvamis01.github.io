This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a lightly-modified [Maverick theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/maverick/) and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I like how simple static sites can be.

I use Bricolage Grotesque for this site's font.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as my CMS, which I use because I like writing blog posts in Markdown. I can securely save the code locally, and it's relatively future-proof.

I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) in Terminal to push updates from Obsidian to Github. I wasnâ€™t very familiar with the Command Line before using it. I made this process easier by creating a hotkey in Obsidian using the [Shell Commands](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands) community plug-in. I write and edit posts in Obsidian, then press my custom hotkey to publish it to my website. The main downside of this set-up is I can't publish blog posts from mobile.

I use [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) to track projects, write notes, and do my professional work. I use the [Notion Saver](https://www.savetonotion.so/) browser extension to save articles online to my Notion for annotation and reference. This is also handy for saving my own work. I don't use Notion as my CMS because it's too clunky; Git and Obsidian are relatively future-proof.
